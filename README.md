# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I honestly was motivated to learn something new and try to complete a new task that iâ€™v never done before.
I built this study guide to have a clear visual of all my notes on one page, also to learn how to create an application and lastly to be prepared for the bootcamp.
The problem is there is so much information for boot camp students that it can can be overwhelming at times to keep track of this information this application solves that problem.
I learned about the command line and Version Control and how we use it track and make changes to our codebase, also how to set up SSH keys and how to create a new repository. I also learned about some of the programming languages that we will be using such as, HTML, CSS, and JAvaScript.
